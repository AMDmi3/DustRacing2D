Contribution "instructions"
===========================

Getting the up-to-date source
-----------------------------

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/dustrac/code dustrac-code

- master branch has the current released stuff and is stable
- dev branch has unreleased stuff and might be unstable

Create a new branch of master for your work.

Game / Editor
-------------

If you have fixed a bug or modified the game in some other acceptable way,
I most likely want to receive the change as a Git patch (make a commit of your changes
in your working branch, and then take "git diff master > your_change.patch"). 

Please follow the existing coding style and use spaces for indentation instead of tabs.

Adding/updating translations
----------------------------

Qt's translation source files for the game are at:

src/game/translations/

Editor:

src/editor/translations/

You can just copy these files as a new locale and edit, but the recommended way is
to generate/update the file from source code to make sure that the source strings
are up-to-date:

$ lupdate src/game/*.cpp -ts  src/game/translations/dustrac-game_fr.ts
$ lupdate src/editor/*.cpp -ts  src/editor/translations/dustrac-editor_fr.ts

..as an example for French.

The .ts-files can then be opened in Qt's translation GUI, linguist.

For Qt4, the Ubuntu package for these tools is qt4-linguist-tools.

A fallback character mapping is in src/game/graphicsfactory, as the texture font used in the
game doesn't support all accented characters, e.g. "รก" is mapped to "a". This map can also
be extended, if needed.

In the case of a new locale, src/game/CMakeLists.txt and src/editor/CMakeLists.txt
need to be modified so that the .ts files are compiled into corresponding .qm files.
The .qm files are binary files that are actually used by the application:

  # Translation files in src/game/translations (without .ts)
  set(TS dustrac-game_fi dustrac-game_it dustrac-game_cs)

Add your file to the list for both the game and the editor.

Remember to TEST the translations.
