Build & install instructions
============================

Dustrac currently uses CMake as the build system.
The main CMakeLists.txt can be loaded in the QtCreator IDE.

Currently the build depends only on Qt 4.7 (>=)
(libqt4-dev on Ubuntu) + OpenGL development files and no
additional libraries are required.

Dustrac exploits some features of the new C++11
standard, so a compliant compiler is required (GCC 4.6,
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010). 
  
Building from the command line on Linux
---------------------------------------

You need to have CMake installed on your system.

Just run:

$ ./configure

This runs CMake that generates the makefiles.
If everything went ok, run:

$ make

This will build the editor and the game binaries
in bin/editor/ and in bin/game/ respectively.

Installing
----------

Any install steps are not currently required.
The binaries work when started from the directory
that contains the binary.

The binaries only need to find the data-dir that includes
all the runtime data.
