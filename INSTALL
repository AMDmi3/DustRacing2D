Build & install instructions
============================

Dustrac currently uses qmake as the build system,
dustrac.pro being the main project file that
can be loaded in the QtCreator IDE.

Currently the build depends only on Qt 4.7 (>=)
development files (libqt4-dev on Ubuntu) and no
additional libraries are required.

Dustrac exploits some features of the new C++11
standard, so a compliant compiler is required (GCC 4.6,
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010). 
  
Building from the command line
------------------------------

Just run:

$ qmake 
$ make

This will build the editor and the game binaries
in bin/editor/ and in bin/game/ respectively.

Installing
----------

Any install steps are not currently required.
The binaries work when started from the directory
that contains the binary.

The binaries only need to find the data-dir that includes
all the runtime data.
