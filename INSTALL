Build & install instructions
============================

Dustrac currently uses qmake as the build system
and dustrac.pro is the main project file that
can also be loaded in the QtCreator IDE.
The Windows build is tested by running Qt SDK
and QtCreator under Wine. 

Currently the build depends only on Qt 4.7 (>=)
development files (libqt4-dev on Ubuntu) and no
additional libraries are required.

Building from the command line
------------------------------

Just run:

$ qmake 
$ make

This will build the editor and the game binaries
in bin/editor/ and in bin/game/ respectively.

Installing
----------

Any install steps are not currently required.
The binaries work when started from the directory
that contains the binary.

The binaries only need to find the data-dir that includes
all the runtime data.
