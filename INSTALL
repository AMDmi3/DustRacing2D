Build & install instructions
============================

Dustrac currently uses CMake as the build system.

Currently the build depends only on Qt (>= 4.7).
No additional libraries are required.
Dustrac also exploits some features of the new C++11
standard, so a C++11 compliant compiler is required (GCC >= 4.6).

Building in the command line on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.04)
--------------------------------------------------------------

1) Install Qt development files (libqt4-dev on Ubuntu).
2) Install CMake from the Software Center.
3) Go to the source directory and run:

$ ./configure

This runs CMake that generates the makefiles.
If everything went ok, run:

$ make

This will build the editor and the game binaries
in bin/editor/ and in bin/game/ respectively.

Building by using QtCreator on Windows (tested on Windows 7)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download and install CMake.
2) Download and install QtCreator + Qt SDK.
3) Download the newest MinGW (GNU compiler tools for Windows).
   Replace the MinGW that came with QtCreator with the one you
   downloaded. No need to do this, if the version of g++ in Qt SDK
   is already >= 4.6.
4) Make sure that the path to Qt binaries are in your PATH
   (You should be able to run qmake from the command prompt without
   the absolute path).
5) Start QtCreator and open the top-level CMakeLists.txt from the
   Dust Racing source directory.
6) Run CMake and build.

3) Run CMake and build.

Installing
----------

Any install steps are not currently required.
The binaries work when started from the directory
that contains the binary.

The binaries only need to find the data-dir that includes
all the runtime data.
