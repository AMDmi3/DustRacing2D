Build & install instructions
============================

Dustrac currently uses qmake as the build system
and dustrac.pro is the main project file that
can also be loaded from the QtCreator IDE.

Currently the build depends only on Qt 4.x
development files (libqt4-dev on Ubuntu).

Build from command line:

$ qmake
$ make

This will build the editor and the game binaries.

Install (as root):

$ make install
