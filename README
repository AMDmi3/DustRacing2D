Playing
-------

The player one controls the pink race car:

Accelerate : Up / RIGHT SHIFT
Brake      : Down / RIGHT CTRL
Turn left  : Left
Turn right : Right

The player two controls the grey race car (game mode
can be selected in the Settings menu):

Accelerate : W / LEFT SHIFT
Brake      : S / LEFT CTRL
Turn left  : A
Turn right : D

The key configuration can be changed in the settings menu.

ESC or Q exits the race and also the current menu.

Dust Racing searches for race tracks also in ~/DustRacingTracks/
where you can place your own race tracks.
