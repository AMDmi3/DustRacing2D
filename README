======

Dust Racing (Dustrac) is a tile-based, cross-platform 2D racing game written
in Qt (C++) and OpenGL.

Dust Racing comes with a Qt-based level editor for easy level creation.
A separate engine, MiniCore, is used for physics modeling.

Playing
=======

Controls
--------

The default controls for player one (the pink race car):

Accelerate | Brake | Turn left | Turn right
---------- | ----- | --------- | ----------
Up         | Down  | Left      | Right

The default controls for player two (the grey race car):

Accelerate | Brake | Turn left | Turn right
---------- | ----- | --------- | ----------
W          | S     | A         | D

The key configuration and game mode can be changed in the settings menu.

ESC or Q exits the race and also the current menu.

P pauses the game.

Races
-----

In the race modes there are always 12 cars. By finishing in TOP-6 a new track
will be unlocked.

The record times and best positions are stored separately for each lap count.

Pit stops
---------

Your tires will wear out as the race progresses. This causes more and more sliding.

Fortunately there's a pit (the yellow rectangle). 
By stopping on the pit your tires will be repaired.

Custom track files
------------------

Dust Racing searches for race tracks also in ~/DustRacingTracks/
where you can place your own race tracks.

Command line options
====================

--lang [lang] forces the language. Currently available: fi, cs, it, fr.

E.g. ./dustrac-game --lang it

Performance
===========

Dust Racing 2D tries to render at least at 60 fps. If you experience very slow
performance, try first to set vsync off (Settings => GFX => Vsync).

Another option would be to force Vsync off via your driver settings.
