Dust Racing (Dustrac) is a tile-based, cross-platform 2D racing game written
in Qt (C++) and OpenGL.

Dust Racing comes with a Qt-based level editor for easy level creation.
A separate engine, MiniCore, is used for physics modeling.

Playing
-------

The player controls the pink race car by arrow keys:

Up    : Accelerate
Down  : Brake
Left  : Turn left
Right : Turn right

ESC or Q exits the race and also the current menu.

Dust Racing searches for race tracks also in ~/DustRacingTracks/
where you can place your own race tracks.

Source code
-----------

The source tree includes source code for the track editor and
the game itself. The game uses an 2D engine called MiniCore
written by Jussi Lind. The code is "documented" by using
Doxygen tags.

The source tree layout:

src/game/          : Source files for the game.
src/game/MiniCore/ : Source files for the graphics/physics engine.
src/editor/        : Source files for the track editor.
src/common/        : Shared files between the editor and the game.
src/images/        : Some SVG-images used as the source for final images.
